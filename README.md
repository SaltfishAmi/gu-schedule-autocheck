# gu-schedule-autocheck

## motivation

It's registration season, but the Fall 2023 schedules of the Computer Science department sadly does not seem to be complete.

I'm so tempted to check it every ten minutes to see if there is any amazing new class for me.

But no.

We are computer programmers, so it's my most natural reaction to spend 5 hours automating this, rather than manually checking it in a recurring manner in the future.

And I know manually checking it a few times a day would take much less than 5 hours in total. Yeah, I know that. But who cares.

## disclaimer

Quick sketch and dirty code, but works. I suck at Python. Honestly.

No warranty. Use it only if you understand the code.
